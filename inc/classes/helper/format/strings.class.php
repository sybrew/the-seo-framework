	 *              2. Moved input-parameter alterting filters outside of this function.

	 * @since 4.2.0 Now supports detection of connector-dashes, connector-punctuation, and closing quotes,
	 *              and recognizes those as whole words.
	 * @since 5.0.0 1. Now converts input string as UTF-8. This mainly solves issues with attached quotes (d'anglais).

	 *
	 * @since 2.6.0
	 * @since 3.1.0 1. Now uses smarter trimming.
	 *              2. Deprecated 2nd parameter.
	 *              3. Now has unicode support for sentence closing.
	 *              4. Now strips last three words when preceded by a sentence closing separator.
	 *              5. Now always leads with (inviting) dots, even if the sentence is shorter than $max_char_length.
	 * @since 4.0.0 1. Now stops parsing earlier on failure.
	 *              2. Now performs faster queries.
	 *              3. Now maintains last sentence with closing punctuations.
	 * @since 4.0.5 1. Now decodes the sentence input, improving accuracy, and so that HTML entities at
	 *                 the end won't be transformed into gibberish.
	 * @since 4.1.0 1. Now texturizes the sentence input, improving accuracy with included closing & final punctuation support.
	 *              2. Now performs even faster queries, in most situations. (0.2ms/0.02ms total (worst/best) @ PHP 7.3/PCRE 11).
	 *                 Mind you, this method probably boots PCRE and wptexturize; so, it'll be slower than what we noted--it's
	 *                 overhead that otherwise WP, the theme, or other plugin would cause anyway. So, deduct that.
	 *              3. Now recognizes connector and final punctuations for preliminary sentence bounding.
	 *              4. Leading punctuation now excludes symbols, special annotations, opening brackets and quotes,
	 *                 and marks used in some latin languages like ¡¿.
	 *              5. Is now able to always strip leading punctuation.
	 *              6. It will now strip leading colon characters.
	 *              7. It will now stop counting trailing words towards new sentences when a connector, dash, mark, or ¡¿ is found.
	 *              8. Now returns encoded entities once more. So that the return value can be treated the same as anything else
	 *                 revolving around descriptions--preventing double transcoding like `&amp;amp; > &amp; > &` instead of `&amp;`.
	 * @since 4.1.5 1. The second parameter now accepts values again. From "current description length" to minimum accepted char length.
	 *              2. Can now return an empty string when the input string doesn't satisfy the minimum character length.
	 *              3. The third parameter now defaults to 4096, so no longer unexpected results are created.
	 *              4. Resolved some backtracking issues.
	 *              5. Resolved an issue where a character followed by punctuation would cause the match to fail.
	 * @since 4.2.0 Now enforces at least a character length of 1. This prevents needless processing.
	 * @since 4.2.7 Now considers floating numerics as one word.
	 * @since 5.0.0 1. Moved from \The_SEO_Framework\Load.
	 *              2. Renamed from `trim_excerpt()`.
	 *              3. Anchored the first regex to the start prevent catastrophic backtracking when no spacing is found.
	 *              4. Forced a useful match in the first regex to prevent catastrophic backtracking in the second regex.
	 * @since 5.0.3 In the first regex, the last word of a sentence shorter than maximum length without leading punctuation is now considered.
	 * @see https://secure.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.unicode.php
	 *
	 * We use `[^\P{Po}\'\":]` because WordPress texturizes ' and " to fall under `\P{Po}`.
	 * This is perfect. Please have the courtesy to credit us when taking it. :)
