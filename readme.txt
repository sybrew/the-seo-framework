= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This even means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Numbers don't lie, performance matters =
Optimizing SEO is a fundamental process for any website. So we try to be non-intrusive with The SEO Framework.
The SEO Framework is byte and process optimized on PHP level, with each update the optimization is improved when possible.
Page rendering time matters in SEO. This is where we lay focus on.

* This plugin is written with massive and busy (multi-)sites in mind.
* This plugin uses various caching methods which store heavy calculations in memory and the database.
* This plugin is on average 1.49x to 1.95x faster compared to other popular SEO plugins.
* This plugin consumes on average 1.42x more server resources than other popular SEO plugins in exchange for improved performance.
* This plugin has on average 1.30 to 1.60x more database interactions in exchange for improved performance.
* And last but not least, this plugin always has 100% fewer advertisements. Let's keep it that way.

*Numbers may vary per installation and version. Last checked: 14th May 2016*
*The numbers are based on actual plugin code runtime.*

= Completely pluggable =
The SEO Framework also features pluggable functions. All functions are active and can be called within the WordPress Loop.
This allows other developers to extend the plugin wherever needed.
We have also provided an API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= Still not convinced? Let's dive deeper =

**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including image manipulation.
* Canonical, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Schema.org LD+Json script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org LD+Json script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org LD+Json script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org LD+Json script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Disables 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yahoo on Post or Page update when sitemaps are enabled.
=======
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.
>>>>>>> ef405fe90ddfcedfe3f7898dcde7198f4eccf621

**This plugin allows you to manually set these values for each post, page, supported CPT and term:**

* Title
* Description
* Canonical URL
* Robots (nofollow, noindex, noarchive)
* Redirect, with optional Multisite spam filter (Post/Page/CPT only)
* Local on-site search settings (Post/Page/CPT only)

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap intergration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And much, much more.

**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

> This plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/) and the [Domain Mapping plugin by Donncha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/).<br>
> This compatibility ensures **prevention of canonical errors**. This way your site will always be correctly indexed, no matter what you use!<br>

= Caching =

This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

**If you use object caching:**
The output will be stored for each page, if you've edited a page the page output Meta will stay the same until the object cache expires. So be sure to clear your object cache or wait until it expires.

**Used Caches:**

* Server-level Opcode (optimized).
* Staticvar functions (prevents running code twice or more).
* Staticvar class (instead of discouraged globals, prevents constructors running multiple times).
* Object caching for unique database calls and full front-end output.
* Transients for process intensive operations and persistent communication with front-and back end.

**All caching plugins are supported. If you use one, be sure to clear your cache when you want to robots to notice your changes.**

= Compatibility =

**Basics:**

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).

**Plugins:**

* W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, Batcache, etc.
* WooCommerce: Shop Page, Products, Product Breadcrumbs, Product Galleries, Product Categories and Product Tags.
* Custom Post Types, (all kinds of plugins) with automatic integration.
* WPMUdev and Donncha's Domain Mapping with full HTTPS support.
* WPMUdev Avatars for og:image and twitter:image if no other image is found.
* bbPress: Forums, Topics, Replies.
* BuddyPress profiles.
* Ultimate Member profiles.
* AnsPress Questions, Profiles and Pages, also Canonical errors have been fixed.
* StudioPress SEO Data Transporter for Posts and Pages.
* WPML, URLs, full sitemap and per-page/post SEO settings (Documentation is coming soon).
* qTranslate X, URLs, full sitemap and per-page/post SEO settings (Documentation is coming soon).
* Confirmed Jetpack modules: Custom Content Types (Testimonials, Portfolio), Infinite Scroll, Photon, Sitemaps, Publicize.
* Most popular SEO plugins, let's not get in each other's way.
* Many, many other plugins, yet to confirm.

**Themes:**

* All themes.
* Special extended support for Genesis & Genesis SEO. This plugin takes all Post, Page, Category and Tag SEO values from Genesis and uses them within The SEO Framework Options. The easiest upgrade!

If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will most likely automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.

= Transferring SEO data using SEO Data Transporter =

Because this plugin was initially written to extend the Genesis SEO, it uses the same option name values. This makes transferring from Genesis SEO to The SEO Framework work automatically.

> If you didn't use Genesis SEO previously, Nathan Rice (StudioPress) has created an awesome plugin for your needs to transfer your SEO data.
>
> Get the [SEO Data Transporter from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-data-transporter/).
>
> Usage:<br>
> 1. Install and activate SEO Data Transporter.<br>
> 2. Go to the <strong>SEO Data Transporter menu within Tools</strong>.<br>
> 3. Select your <strong>previous SEO plugin</strong> within the first dropdown menu.<br>
> 4. Select <strong>Genesis</strong> within the second dropdown menu.<br>
> 5. Click <strong>Analyze</strong> for extra information about the data transport.<br>
> 6. Click <strong>Convert</strong> to convert the data.
>
> The SEO Framework now uses the same data from the new Genesis SEO settings on Posts, Pages and Taxonomies.

= About the Sitemap =

The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

= Other notes =

*Genesis SEO will be disabled upon activating this plugin. This plugin takes over and extends Genesis SEO.*

***The Automatic Description Generation will work with any installation, but it will exclude shortcodes. This means that if you use shortcodes or a page builder, be sure to enter your custom description or the description will fall short.***

***The home page tagline settings won't have any effect on the title output if your theme's title output is not written according to the WordPress standards, which luckily are enforced strongly on new WordPress.org themes since recently.***

> <strong>Check out the "[Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/#Other-Notes)" tab for the API documentation.</strong>

*I'm aware that radio buttons lose their input when you drag the metaboxes around. This issue is fixed since WordPress 4.5.0 (alpha and later).*
*But not to worry: Your previous setting will be returned on save. So it's like nothing happened.*

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!

1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 70 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer, how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I'm not a developer, how can I help? =

A way of donating is available through the donation link on the plugin website.
However, you can also greatly help by telling your friends about this plugin :).

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= No ads! Why? =

Nope, no ads! No nags! No links! Never!
Why? Because I hate them, probably more than you do.
I also don't want to taint your website from the inside, like many popular plugins do.
Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

***But how do you make a living?***

Currently, The SEO Framework is non-profit.
This plugin was first released to the public in March 15th, 2015. From there it has grown, from 179 lines of code, to more than 17100 lines.
With over 600,000 characters of code written, this plugin is absolutely a piece of art in my mind.
And that's what it should stay, (functional) art.
I trust that people are good at heart and will tell their friends and family about the things they enjoy the most, what they're excited about, what they find beneficial or even beautiful.

With The SEO Framework I try to achieve exactly that. It's made with <3.

= Does this plugin collect my data? =

Absolutely not! Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

= Premium version? =

Nope! Only premium extensions. These are planned and being developed.

= If a premium extensions is released, what will happen to this plugin? =

This plugin is built to be an all-in-one SEO solution for professional environments, so:

1. No advertisements about the premium extensions will be placed within this plugin.
1. No features will be removed or replaced for premium-only features.
1. The premium extensions will most likely only be used for big-business SEO. Which are very difficult to develop and which will confuse most users anyway.

= I've heard about an extension manager, what's that? =

Currently it's not available. When it is, it will allow you to download and activate extensions for The SEO Framework. It will support both multisite and single-site and the registration will be based on the Akismet plugin.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not a problem. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's useability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The (home page) title is different from the og:title, or doesn't do what I want or told it to. =

The theme you're using is using outdated standards and is therefore doing it wrong. Inform your theme author about this issue.

Give the theme author these two links: https://codex.wordpress.org/Title_Tag https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/25/title-tag-support-now-required/

If you know your way around PHP, you can speed up this process by replacing the `<title>some code here</title>` code with `<title><?php wp_title('') ?></title>` within the `header.php` file of the theme you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.
If you're using W3 Total Cache you might be interested in [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3tc-auto-pilot/) to do it for you.

= Ugh, I don't want anyone to know I'm using The SEO Framework! =

Aww :(
Oh well, here's the filter you need to remove the HTML tags saying where the Meta tags are coming from:
`add_filter( 'the_seo_framework_indicator', '__return_false' );`

= I'm fine with The SEO Framework, but not with you! =

Well then! D: We got off on the wrong foot, I guess..
If you wish to remove only my name from your HTML code, here's the filter:
`add_filter( 'sybre_waaijer_<3', '__return_false' );`

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

<<<<<<< HEAD
= 2.5.2.4 - Secure Globals =

**Summarized**

* This minor security update ensures the Runway Framework theme compatibility as well as resolving some minor security concerns.

**For everyone:**

* Fixed: Global Page/Paged vars could (undesirably) be overwritten by external themes, causing the website to crash on archives.
* Improved: Various admin-only sanitation features.

= 2.5.2.3 - Unfamiliar Homefront =

**Summarized:**

* 2.6.0 and all its promised features are still being developed and is due in April.

**For everyone:**

* Fixed: When the Home Page is a blog, it could be seen as an empty Archive when no Posts are set to published.
* Note: This detection is actually a feature to prevent bad Archives and 404 pages from being indexed. Alas, the Home Page has enough settings and can be uncommonly adjusted by Themes and (builder) Plugins.

**For whoever was affected:**

* First off, I'm terribly sorry for this inconvenience and this negative hit on your Home Page.
* Luckily, its effects aren't lasting and your Home Page will be reindexed automatically.
* Your website was only affected by this bug if you have 0 posts published, and - at the same time - if your Home Page isn't assigned as a Static Page, but a Blog.

**For whoever was affected and wants to speed things up:**

* You can manually reindex your Home Page with Google and the Bing Search Network (Yahoo!, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others whom use the Bing Search Network).
* To do this, perform the following steps. Be sure to clear all your caches beforehand:

***Google:***

1. Go to [Google Webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) and sign up if you haven't already.
1. Add your property if you haven't already.
1. Verify your property if you haven't already. You can add the verification code they give within the Webmasters Settings metabox within the SEO Settings page. Be sure to clear your cache.
1. Go to your property.
1. On the left, go to `Crawl => Fetch as Google`.
1. Without changing any details, hit "Fetch and Render".
1. It takes up to 3 days for Google to re-index your Home Page.

***Bing Search Network:***

1. Go to [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster) and sign up if you haven't already.
1. Add your property if you haven't already.
1. Verify your property if you haven't already. You can add the verification code they give within the Webmasters Settings metabox within the SEO Settings page. Be sure to clear your cache.
1. Go to your property.
1. On the left, go to `Diagnostics & Tools => Fetch as Bingbot`.
1. Enter your Home Page URL and hit "Fetch".
1. Wait a little and Bing will output the source of your page on success.
1. It takes up to 3 days for Bing to re-index your Home Page. It takes up to 14 days for the network to catch up.

= 2.5.2.2 - Description Conditions =

**Summarized:**

* 2.6.0 is already underway, but I found the following fix mandatory. So here is 2.5.2.2!
* This minor update makes sure the social description is as intended when you choose to remove the blogname from the regular description.

**For everyone:**

* Fixed: When description additions are disabled, the social description is no longer "Title on Blogname".

= 2.5.2.1 - Unforeseen Improvements =

**Summarized:**

* This minor update brings you a special scenario fix that caused an unnecessary browser alert.
* Also, object caching now works as intended and you can see a minor performance improvement when used.
=======
= 2.6.0 - Pragmatic Foundation =

**Release date:**

* May 16th 2016

**Preamble:**

* This is a dot version bump update, which is done so as the core code has been changed drastically. Nine new classes have been added to maintain structured code, including many more function to fetch data easily and consistently.
* With hundreds of changes, I had to find a new way to present this update in an understandable manner. So here goes!

**Summarized:**

* With over 200 notable changes, I bring you a new Pragmatic Foundation.
* Most importantly, this update allows you to be better informed about your website's index status, through the much improved SEO bar.
* As the issue of the incorrect title length has finally been found, this update glorifies and updates its plugin's title counter once more.
* Many new options have been included within the SEO Settings page. Including much desired Title, Description and Schema.org options.
* WPML compatibility has received a rework, now all canonical URLs in the sitemap and front-end are always correct. The qTranslate X settings are now also being taken into account when outputting canonical URLs.
* A new script has been added on the front-page. This will make sure the Breadcrumb homepage name will be correct in the Search Engine Results Page.
* The breadcrumb script has been expanded to work on posts with multiple and nested categories. These scripts now also work on WooCommerce products. Don't be surprised if you suddenly have all kinds of scripts in the header! These scripts help Google and other Search Engines better understand your website.
* And for developers, with the code expanding rapidly, this update brings new light to the code by reorganizing the code into dedicated classes and is including many major refactorizations.

**Feature highlights:**

* **New:**
	* WooCommerce Schema.org breadcrumbs.
	* Intelligently nested Schema.org breadcrumbs.
	* Schema.org website name.
	* Vibrant character counters for when you need extra visual assistance.
	* The SEO Bar's tooltip is now able to speak to you through accessiblity tools.
	* More Automated Description options.
	* New Archive Title, Sitemap and Schema.org options.
	* Yandex Sitemap pinging support.
	* Automatic option merging on update.
	* AJAX integration when adding tags.
	* Personalized error handling for developers.
	* Over 150 new public functions for developers.
	* More than 20 brand new filters for developers.
	* WP Query Admin synchronization for developers.
	* Automated setting navigation tabs for developers.
* **Improved:**
	* Better Automated Description sentence punctuations.
	* Modernized and Smarter SEO bar, with many more conditional checks.
	* Many linguistic improvements, with more flow in the SEO Bar.
	* Extended Title Fix extension support.
	* More efficient cache key generation.
	* Adaptive WPML & qTranslate X URL generation.
	* Better editorial translations.
	* JetPack compatibility.

**SEO Tip of the Update: Redirects & Canonical**

* A change in the Canonical URL or the use of a 301 Redirect URL indicate that your page has moved.
* These can be seen by Search Engines as the same. However, the 301 Redirect enforces the relocation of the page to everyone, whereas the Canonical URL softly indicates.
* When changing the Canonical URL of a Page, you're telling robots to look and elsewhere, be sure to include a link to the new Page on the canonicalized Page to indicate where everything has moved to.
* However, it's even better to enforce a 301 redirect. This makes sure both your visitors as Search Engines know where to be instantaneously.
* If you've changed the permalink of a popular post, you should create an empty post that follows one of the said examples.

**Announcements:**

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Improved: The HTML plugin indicators now ignore object cache. Making the filter more responsive.
* Fixed: The HTML plugin indicator timer translation is now put to use (oops).
* Fixed: JavaScript bug caused by undefined error where the user was prompted for settings change while there weren't any on the Post or Page edit screens when the **"Remove blogname from title?"** option is checked or when editing the home page and the **"Add site description (tagline) to the Title on the Home Page?"** is unchecked.
* Fixed: Incompatible object cache group names.
* Removed: Twitter card and Twitter title output on 404 and search pages. The Twitter tags rely on other tags which can't be rendered in their full extend by default on these pages. Twitter uses OG tags to fall back on.
* Note: The per-page output cache key has changed for the output, this forces the object cache to be invalidated.
=======
* Back when I started developing this update, I announced a new extension plugin for The SEO Framework! [Title Fix - The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-title-fix/).
* This update ensures extra compatibility with the Title Fix plugin, this will add back removed title features for if the theme is doing it wrong and when the Title Fix plugin is active.
>>>>>>> ef405fe90ddfcedfe3f7898dcde7198f4eccf621

**About: Plugin progression and help wanted:**

* This dear project has taken me over 2500 hours to perfect and maintain. This update alone has cost me over 220 hours to complete.
* I really want to keep this project free. In fact, Author SEO was actually planned to be a premium extension.
* I also want to turn this project into my full-time job, even if it's free from monetization and/or premium content.
* And I will keep my promises, always: This plugin will stay free of ads, (self-)reference and this plugin will continue to be maintained.
* All with all, this means I can't do it without your help!
* Please consider making a donation. The link can be found on the WordPress.org plugin page. Or [here](https://theseoframework.com/?p=572).
* Thank you so much for your support!

**About: Changes in Changelog**

* I love to push many changes at once every update, as I'm only happy when everything works. If I find a bug, I'll be sure to fix it!
* So to clean up the massive all-inclusive changelogs, detailed information on updates are put aside and are visible on the plugin's website.
* With each update, I try to find better ways for presenting information and I try to minimize confusion.

**No Stone Left Unturned:**

* This massive update has touched almost every aspect of this plugin.
* With this, many fixes are put into effect for all known and possibly many unknown bugs. Better standards have been put into place, both for WordPress and the coding world.
* All changes have been tested thoroughly. However, it's always possible something has been overlooked. If you find anything out of place, let me know in the [plugin support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription)!

**For everyone - Squared SEO Bar:**

* From now on, the SEO bar is flat and squared. This gives a more modern look and feel.
* Screen Readers are now able to enunciate the tooltip when shown.

**For everyone - New Options Merging:**

* From this plugin update, new default options are automatically merged with the previous options on update.
* This way, you don't have to update each site you own with the new recommended features.
* No options will be overwritten in this process, and it only happens once in the admin area when the plugin is active and the one who can edit the site's SEO options is loading the site.
* This new feature is multisite compatible and can be disabled through a filter.
* When this happens, a dismissible update notification will show whenever this happens.
* The notification is unbranded, it will say "New SEO options have been updated." on the SEO Settings Page and will add "View the new options here." on all other Admin Pages.

**For everyone - Schema Markup:**

* New schema markup has been added, this helps Search Engines better understand your website.
* Breadcrumbs have been expanded, to support nested categories and multiple categories. Now you can see multiple breadcrumb scripts to help Search Engines better understand your website's structure.
* Breadcrumbs scripts now also work on WooCommerce products, enjoy!

**For translators - High priority translations:**

* Please look for **Front-end output** comments within the translation page to find high-priority translations.

**For translators - Linguistic improvements and other changes:**

* Objective translations for grammatically gendered noun types like "this post" (male in Dutch) and "this page" (genderless in Dutch) within sentences which are fetched dynamically (like "Product" and "Product Tag" for WooCommerce) couldn't be translated correctly.
* Therefore, I've changed these types of sentences without any loss of understanding.
* Small changes within translations happen over time, although I try to keep these to the necessary minimum. Nevertheless, as this is an ongoing project you can expect continuous improvements wherever possible. Translating WordPress and its plugins are a team effort :).
* Other small changes include conversion of WordPress slang to real English. Like "Paged" to "Paginated".
* Over time, inconsistencies have appeared within the language used within this plugin. These have been fixed. If you still find any, please notify me through the support forums and I'll address them.
* Thanks @pidengmor for many (over 40) linguistic improvements, they're really appreciated! Thank you so much for your time!
* I also want to make a big shout out to all the other translators who have contributed to this plugin! <3
* And if you wish to become a language editor, just let me know!

**For developers - Performance:**

* Because this plugin has grown massively in size with this update, the memory use has been increased marginally (to 4MB from 2.7MB). This shouldn't cause issues. And to improve this, singleton methods are going to be considered.
* Because many more items are being rendered, the plugin is a tad slower than before, even though overall performance has been improved. This won't affect your website's performance noticeably.
* This plugin has been benchmarked with PHP Xdebug. With it I found that some functions affected the performance marginally, and have thus been fixed accordingly.

**For developers - Refactoring classes:**

* The classes `AutoDescription_DoingItRight` and `AutoDescription_Generate` among others have been greatly refactored to improve performance and maintainability.
* Almost all public functions before this overhaul have maintained their initial behavior, the generation of the output has just been split over multiple functions. If this is not the case, and unexpected variables are input, a deprecation notice is output.

**For developers - WordPress Query Sync:**

* The current WordPress query only works on the front-end.
* `/inc/classes/query.class.php` contains alternative functions based on the WordPress query. However, although these functions work just like WordPress Core query functions, they also look for the screens within the admin area.
* These functions do not work on custom post types, yet. But they do work on WooCommerce products and product categories.
* This resulted in easing the whole code base as it doesn't have to check for admin/front-end per-function anymore. Further improvements are planned, but this update already contains most of the overhaul.

**Looking forward - Upcoming features:**

Not all planned features made it into 2.6.0. The following features are planned to be released in a future version.

* Author SEO (Title, Description, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.).
* Google+ output options.
* The SEO Bar options.
* Per page title additions options.
* Canonical SEO (URL scheme options).
* Article modified time output options, just like the Sitemap time output options.
* Image Description as an excerpt for the attachment's page meta descriptions.
* Twitter card plugin detection and subtle notification of such.
* WP.me shortlink integration.

**Detailed log:**

***There are a lot more changes in this update which did not make it to this page. Please refer to [the detailed changelog](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1196#detailed).***

*What do you think of this change? Let me know at [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/) (no support questions there, please)!*

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* Default options merging on plugin update, so you don't have to check out the new features manually with each update. When new features are added which have not yet been registered. These features will now be updated to its default settings. Multisite compatible.
	* Archive title prefix options!
	* Schema SEO!
	* Schema SEO will allow you to enable and disable global Schema.org features.
	* LD+Json Schema.org website name and URL header markup on the front-page. This should change the `example.com > category > subcategory` output in Google to `Example Site > category > subcategory`. See [this page](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/site-name) for more info.
	* Time display options for the sitemap. Now you can select how the time is output. Default "Complete date plus hours, minutes and time zone".
	* Buffer cleaner before the sitemap begins outputting. This makes sure the sitemap can't be erroneous through other plugin or theme errors.
	* New global Automated Description options.
	* Removal of the three dots after the description if the excerpt ends with a dot, question mark or exclamation point.
	* Removal commas if the excerpt ends with one in the automated description.

	* Yandex Webmasters verification code support.
	* Description excerpt detection. Now when an excerpt is filled in, no description additions will be added in front of them.
	* Lowered pinging response time to 3s from 5s, to reduce max script time to 12s from 20s on post publish.
	* The SEO Bar now has a Double Title check (will appear red). This will make sure that you can see where the copy of SEO data went wrong.

	* The SEO Bar will now show an exclamation mark when the Post ID can't be found. It's quite nice, and you probably won't ever see it :(.
	* Non-executive `index.php` files in folders which contain readable files, to prevent indexing of such.
	* WooCommerce breadcrumbs support!
	* Nested post categories now also have a breadcrumb script. Multiple even, when applicable.

	* Descriptive URL on Title Blogname removal option.
	* Title generation cache. It no longer gets generated more than once per page load.
	* Feed location URL in the Feed Settings.
	* Disabling of JetPack Open Graph when The SEO Framework Open Graph is active.
	* JetPack sitemap detection. When the Jetpack module is active, default "sitemap detected" behavior of this plugin follows. Which is showing a notification in the Sitemap settings and deactivating its functions for output.

	* Moved SEO Bar before bbPress Reply Created.
	* The sitemap, theme doing it right, description and LD+Json transient keys have been invalidated.
	* Open Graph plugin detection now only shows a notification, instead of removing OG output as well. These values may be duplicated (although undesired).
	* When a Custom Home Page Title Tagline is set, it's now used for the Title on the description on the home page.
	* When no Blog Tagline has been set, it will now return "Untitled".

* **Improved:**
	* The SEO Bar's now more reliable in its data.
	* The SEO Bar hover balloon linguistics, **"but"** now can't show up twice when the fact is enforcing upon its state, and is instead replaced with **"and"**. E.g. "But the blog isn't set to public. And there are no posts..."

	* WPMUdev Domain Mapping database values are now all fetched in one query instead of two.
	* External SEO plugin detection, it now uses constants to search for when applicable.
	* External Sitemap plugin detection, it now uses constants to search for when applicable.
	* Settings tabs vertical icon alignment.
	* The Home Page settings are now divided with navigation tabs.
	* No more accidents: The setting checkbox labels now don't overflow anymore to the width of its container. This means you have to click on the text for the checkbox to change, rather than also possibly on the whitespace next to it. In the future all checkboxes and radio buttons will obtain this property.
	* Reduced the chance of WPMUdev Domain Mapping's Async CDSSO Script being incorrect due to unorthodox rewrite flushing.
	* Sitemap flush on post deletion now only runs when post is certainly deleted.

	* Incorrect description was output on some archives.
	* The removal of title additions now correctly reflect on the title counter length when JavaScript is disabled.
	* The removal of title additions are now also reflecting its setting on the placeholders within categories and tags.
	* Some deprecated functions gave a fatal error or warning, this has been resolved.
	* When Reading Settings' Feed Options are set to summary, the backlink is now still shown when enabled.
	* Screen Options showed an SEO column, while there isn't any in pages, posts and terms.
	* When using diacritic characters, like in French, The SEO Bar's description word counter would be incorrect.
	* On WooCommerce product tag search within the dashboard, Products showed the wrong SEO bar.
	* On WooCommerce product tag search within the dashboard, Products could show the wrong post SEO state.
	* On Touching the SEO bar, the pointer could be misplaced.
	* When a category is added, the SEO bar doesn't show an empty and shifted row anymore.

	* Second or later archive pages now allow for pagination in the Canonical URL.
	* When the Home Page title additions location is set to Right and has a title filled in in the in-post SEO Box as well as the Home Page Settings and when the Home Page Settings is emptied, the placeholder title location and additions are reversed when no Tagline options are touched.
	* WordPress version compare could sometimes return incorrect values when dealing with unstable versions.
	* The Canonical URL is now selecting the primary domain when available when using WPMUdev Domain Mapping.
	* Blogname cache wasn't initialized correctly.
	* Blog Description cache wasn't initialized correctly.
	* When using subsets of languages, e.g. "nl-NL-formal", the check no longer falls back to "en_US", but to "nl_NL". This affects `og:locale` in particular.
	* Robots.txt subdirectory admin path is now rendered correctly.
	* Conflicting plugin detection can now detect more than one plugin again.
	* Sitemap and description transients should now always flush on page publish.
	* PHP 5.2 support within the SEO Settings page.
* **Removed:**
	* Shortlink URL from Home Page, as it's quite useless and self-referring there.
	* Yahoo Pinging option and initiation, as they've moved to Bing quite some time ago (oops).
	* WPMUdev Avatars support. As WordPress core has taken over this feature and it was unreliable.
	* Canonical URL from Search and 404 pages. It yields no value on those pages and might even yield incorrect results.
	* Official support for WordPress 3.6 and 3.7. It takes too much time to maintain such backwards compatibility.
* **Note:**
	* This version is yet incompatible with the upcoming Genesis 2.3.0 update. This means that this plugin can no longer automatically merge its data with previously set Genesis Terms data. This issue should be resolved in an upcoming update, which I hope to have released before Genesis 2.3.0.

**For developers:**

* **Added:**
	* New filters! See **Filter Notes** below.
	* More than 150 new functions to make this plugin more maintainable.

	* `AutoDescription_Admin_Init::localize_admin_javascript()` function.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::get_the_real_archive_title()` function, which also works in the admin area and has a term object argument and outputs no HTML, effectively speeding the whole plugin up on archive pages.
	* `AutoDescription_Detect::current_theme_supports_title_tag()` function, returns cached true if theme supports title tag.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::get_all_options()` function.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Url::get_relative_term_url()` second parameter `(array) $args` replaces `(bool) $no_request`.

	* `AutoDescription_Core::post_type_support()` now has an array argument parameter.
	* `AutoDescription_Core::get_the_real_ID()` now returns 0 instead of false if no ID is found.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::build_title_notagline()` is now protected.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title_for_terms()` now uses `array $args` for parameters.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::generate_title()` now uses `array $args` for parameters.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()` admin functions now don't rely on `$args['meta']` anymore to bypass doing it wrong detection, but rather on `is_admin()` checks.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()`'s `$args['meta']` is now set to default `false`.
	* CSS and JS file identifiers have their duplicated `css` or `js` removed. So `autodescription-css-css` is now `autodescription-css`, and so forth.
* **Updated:**
	* JS files and cache.
	* CSS files and cache.
* **Reworked:**
	* Class structure and order.
	* `AutoDescription_DoingItRight` and all its contents.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Description` and all its contents.

	* Functions have been put in their respective aptly named classes where applicable.
	* Debugging has been modified to clean up the code greatly.
	* Metabox Setting Navigation Tabs, now your tabs are automatically styled and integrated when using the `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::nav_tab_wrapper()` function. It's also less "search-and-destroy" and thus easier on the browser.
	* The metabox navigation tabs' content is now also automatically aligned.
	* All SEO Settings page checkboxes are now wrapped in a normalized function for a more seamless integration and if-needed adjustments.
	* `AutoDescription_TermData::get_term_filter()` no longer adds SEO data after the SEO output has been set (action `the_seo_framework_do_after_output`). This means the term SEO data might be unreachable afterwards when using `get_term()`.
* **Improved:**
	* Hundreds of type optimization checks in if-statements, not only making it more readable, but also two to forty time less taxing on the CPU per optimization (count the Hertz!).
	* Cached the SEO bar translations.
	* render.class.php filters can now return empty string to disable its output.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` now consumes less memory and has gained support for PHP 5.2.

	* Search query titles aren't escaped twice anymore.
	* Removed duplicated term object calls on term pages, reducing memory usage.
	* When the paged URLs filter is used, the then useless URLs aren't rendered.
	* Plugin settings activation filter usage is now reflected throughout the plugin.
	* When using the plugin settings activation filter, new default options are still applied (which are also filterable).
	* Benchmarks have shown that an array flip to use an `isset` match only benefits huge arrays very little and only when you're certain the result is at the end of the array. Otherwise, it's a drastic performance decrease. Therefore `$this->is_array()` calls have been set back to the default PHP behavior.
	* `og:image` resizing now doesn't use PCRE anymore, but regular PHP find and replace.
	* `og:image` quality has been upped to 82 from 70. This is according to the [new WordPress 4.5.0 standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/22/proposal-increase-the-default-image-compression-in-wordpress/).
	* This plugin's admin CSS and JS are now registered and cached prior to enqueueing. This speeds things up if multiple script calling hooks are used.
	* The Term SEO box initialization now only happens on the term edit screens.
	* Automated Description Example now uses ID's rather than classes for better JavaScript performance.
	* The protected default site options are no longer stored in the object. Evidentily removing the `$warned_site_options` object variable and putting it into a publicly accessible function.
	* The protected warned site options are no longer stored in the object. Evidentily removing the `$default_site_options` object variable and putting it into a publicly accessible function.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::get_warned_settings()` now simply converts the given option values into booleans and then ones and zeros, rather than escaping thoroughly.
	* `AutoDescription_Adminpages::is_default_checked()` now doesn't return `''` anymore when using the echo parameter.
	* `AutoDescription_Adminpages::is_warning_checked()` now doesn't return `''` anymore when using the echo parameter.
	* Disabled the Network options constructor and its class variables, as it's not yet used (and protected).
	* Feed function initialization is now only run on feeds to improve performance.
* **Fixed:**
	* `the_seo_framework_dot_version()` now checks for four dot versions if applicable.
	* `AutoDescription_Core::get_the_real_ID()` won't return the latest post ID anymore on taxonomial archives.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Image::get_image()` now returns something when the third parameter is set to false.
	* The SEO Bar column initialization filter used to be called as an action and mixed echoing and returning. It's now a consistent filter, as WP core suggests.
	* Empty delimiter PHP warning when the theme is doing it wrong and no separator has been provided.
	* Improperly sanitized option, disclosed. Although, it holds no security treat as all options always go through multiple sanitation processes.
	* PHP Warning in the robots.txt output. This will make subdirectory sitemaps work again.
	* JavaScript `undefined TypeError` on mobile screens and Microsoft Edge.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` contained wrong error handling.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` now converts and checks for `$this` correctly. Evidently speeding up the plugin greatly.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` now doesn't return a fatal error anymore if class and method isn't found when the class is referred to as string.
	* LD+Json Home Page flushing cache wasn't initialized correctly on SEO settings save.
	* Warned options cache now works.
	* `AutoDescription::title_for_home()` now correctly fetches the front page title option if called outside of the Home Page loop.
* **Deprecated:**
	* `AutoDescription_Detect::current_theme_supports()`, use core `current_theme_supports` instead.
	* Second parameter for `AutoDescription_Generate_Url::the_url()`, use `$args['id']` instead.
	* `AutoDescription_Debug::echo_debug_information()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Debug::get_debug_information()` and refactored.
	* `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::seo_column()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::seo_bar()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Sitemaps::setup_sitemap_transient()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Sitemaps::setup_sitemap()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Detect::is_locale()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Detect::check_wp_locale()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::get_placeholder_title()` function, use `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()` instead with the argument `notagline`.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::initialize_defaults_admin()` function. Without replacement.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::initialize_defaults()` function. Without replacement.
* **Removed:**
	* Open Graph plugins check from Canonical URL output, these are unrelated.
	* Filter/Constant/Action PHP comments indicating changes from 2.3.0 to clean up code.
	* Title generation `placeholder` argument. Use `get_custom_field` and/or `notagline` instead.
	* Leftover `.postbox-container` CSS adjustment.
	* `AutoDescription_Networkoptions` class.
* **Other:**
	* Cleaned up code, massively.

		* `the_seo_framework_do_after_output`, not to be confused with the filter 'the_seo_framework_after_output'
* **Notes:**
	* I marked numerous functions with `@access private`. These functions can change behavior at any time without prior notice and should never be used in extension plugins, even though publicly accessible. Please duplicate the function if you really need to use it.
	* Please be aware that all CSS classes will change in a future update, to cover a synonymous namespace for The SEO Framework.
	* This plugin is hooking into more than 90 actions and filters. WordPress holds the class information when this is done (because of `$this`) and can take up a lot of memory. To resolve this, class variables holding arrays have been put into functions.
	* There's an upcoming function for the home title. Currently, the blogname and title are unaptly named. This means that the title is the blogname, and the blogname is the title. The current home page title functions are therefore marked private. It will become: "title" - "sep" - "additions", this will be reflected upon throughout the title class.
