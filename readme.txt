### We poured over 27&#160;000 hours of love into this plugin. <br>Here are the results:

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support channels](https://theseoframework.com/support/) at any time to ask a question. More than 5000 inquiries have been answered personally in the past nine years, typically within 72 hours.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search via structured data. It also automatically generates titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines and quickly helps search engines find the website's latest changes via the built-in optimized sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and WhatsApp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

### Unbranded, free and for the professionals

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

### Behind the screens

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

### Compatibility and accessibility

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* Internationalization through WordPress.org. You can [contribute here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription/).

* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, etc.), through its interface and metatag generation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, etc. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= How do I display breadcrumbs? =

The SEO Framework outputs hidden breadcrumbs for search engines to find via its Schema.org settings.

You can also output these breadcrumbs visually in your theme by [using a shortcode](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=212).

== Changelog ==

TODO Add a parent to a page/product, then delete that parent from WordPress (or database, so WordPress cannot rectify) -- then, see if we can get an "Untitled" page/product in the breadcrumb like that.
TODO this messes up the breadcrumbs of TSF: https://woocommerce.com/products/brands/.
TODO set_time_limit() appears to be blocked by many hosts. This might prevent them from using TSF at all?
TODO move user settings to personal_options?
TODO check compatibility with Web Stories.
TODO introduce dark theme for sitemap. Inspired by https://rss.beauty/.
TODO kevin from clearwater would like to beta test https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/700?
	-> But we also have WhatsApp.
TODO allow invoking the sitemap loader via a filter/constant, so that the Google News Sitemap can be loaded regardless of the main sitemap settings.
TODO update phpdoc for the_seo_framework_meta_render_data.
TODO mention we renamed "Twitter meta tags" to "Twitter Card meta tags" -- Translation files need updating!
TODO add a filter akin to the_seo_framework_supported_twitter_card_types for Open Graph types.

TODO WooCommerce 9.6 changed how categories are recognized (from hierarchical to non-hierarchical?). This affects the breadcrumb output.

TODO update residual trailing commas via: ' \)\n\t*\);

TODO add sort by SEO Bar to list views?
	-> This is feasible, e.g.:
		Title/Description: red weight -3, yellow weight -2, grey weight -2, blue -1, green 0.
		Indexing: Noindex red -5, yellow -4, grey -3, blue -2, green 0, etc.
	-> This would mean we render ALL seo bar items in the list view for all pages, which is not ideal. But, we can store this as post meta as the SEO bar is shown (and the meta is missing).
		-> i.e., slow lazy update

TODO don't escape '\\_', just write '\_'.
TODO add `@access private` to compat funcs (or files...)
TODO in `The_SEO_Framework\Data\User::get_userdata()`, we may want implement this in the inc\classes\meta\schema and author classes.

### 5.1.3

**For everyone:**

* **Added:** Comprehensive author meta tag support with global fallback option for improved LinkedIn and social media post sharing.
* **Added:** Author Name Fallback setting in Social Meta Tags > Author Settings for specifying a default author name.
* **Added:** Authorial tags toggle now controls visibility of author profile settings and fallback behavior.
* **Enhanced:** Facebook and Twitter author meta generation now respects the authorial tags setting with proper fallback to global settings.
* **Enhanced:** Profile settings for authorial information are now conditionally displayed based on authorial tags setting.
* **Fixed:** Author meta tags implementation follows WordPress coding standards and TSF architecture patterns.

**For developers:**

* **Added:** `tsf()->author()` method for accessing author meta functionality via the pool pattern.
* **Added:** `post_author` option with proper sanitization and validation.
* **Enhanced:** JavaScript toggle functionality for hiding author override messages when authorial tags are disabled.

This release augments issues #515, #595, #654, and #690 by providing comprehensive author meta tag functionality with global fallback support.

TODO we should probably make this v5.2 (major), and add all the author stuff.
TODO remove all deprecated filters, keep all deprecated methods/functions.

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* We added a new toggle for author meta data in the site settings. It's enabled by default for everyone, for it extends existing plugin behavior.
		* When enabled:
			* A new "author" metatag is added for posts, it shows the "display name" for the author.
				* When disabled the primary author can still be assigned.
			* TODO IMPLEMENT: Authors have "Facebook profile page" and "X profile handle" links added to their profile pages.
				* This is already implemented, but we should toggle the listeners for this.
			* TODO IMPLEMENT "Authors can override this option on their profile page." must be hidden when toggled off.
	* TODO Authors now have all SEO fields on their profile pages, like we have for terms.
	* TODO Authors get the SEO Bar displayed on the author overview list pages.
		* Bonus: This allows you to quickly see who is an Author and who isn't.
		* Non-authors get a medium dash symbol instead of the SEO Bar.
	* TODO You can now sort by SEO Bar status. This revolutionary (wow, I'm marketing!) feature allows you to quickly find posts and terms that need your attention.
* **Fixed:**
	* Abbreviations at the start of sentences are now properly considered by the description generator.
* **Removed:**
	* TODO Compatibility with the Headway theme has been removed. The theme is no longer maintained since 2017 and the developer's website is down.

**For translators:**

* **Updated:**
	* POT translation file.
	* Various sentences have been updated for clarity.

**For developers:**

* **Option notes:**
	* Resolved an issue where pools `tsf()->escape()` and `tsf()->sanitize()` were incorrectly marked to be from pool `tsf()->filter()->escape()` and `tsf()->filter()->sanitize()` respectively.
	* Of option `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`, pool `tsf()->data()->plugin()`, or legacy API `tsf()->get_options()`):
		* Added index `author_meta`. Default `1`, also for existing installations.
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where pools `tsf()->escape()` and `tsf()->sanitize()` were incorrectly marked to be from pool `tsf()->filter()->escape()` and `tsf()->filter()->sanitize()` respectively.
* **Other:**
	* We now properly capitalize the proper noun Boolean.
	* We updated our coding standards, so the code is slightly altered.
	* `tsfCanonicalL10n.allowCanonicalURLNotationTracker` is renamed to `tsfCanonicalL10n.allowCanonicalURLNotationTracker`, which is more consistent with the rest of the codebase.
		* This change is not backward compatible; however, the property was marked with the comment "TEMP: [...]", as it was a quick workaround for a compatibility issue with multilingual plugins.

### 5.1.2

This patch [resolves another issue](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4380) where saving author meta data could cause an error.

### 5.1.1

This tiny update [resolves issues](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4348) our community found with the release of TSF v5.1.

### 5.1.0 - Profound

*The lover of wisdom, then, far surpasses the lover of gain. - [Plato](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D9)*

**Release highlights**

* This update brings a new color scheme that's easier on your eyes. You'll love it tomorrow.
* The canonical URL is now tracked in real-time when editing any page or term.
* You can now block AI trainers and SEO analysis crawlers from using your content.
* We added a warning for image types that aren't compatible with most social platforms.
* You can now set a canonical and redirect URL for the homepage.

**Profound**

After the monumental v5.0 "Apex" update, we're proud to present TSF v5.1 "Profound." It's a less impactful update, bringing only 150 improvements, but every single one aims to make TSF even more user-friendly. Meticulously crafted, unlike anything, this update is yet another testament to our dedication to making WordPress SEO bearable.

**Canonical URL Notation Tracker**

The canonical URL is a critical part of SEO, but WordPress doesn't convey what it becomes when editing the page, only after saving it. Now, you can see it in real-time as a placeholder, depending on your site's permalink settings.

This tracker is accurate. Still, we plan to make it more sophisticated in future updates. It won't reflect category changes in Quick Edit because we must still add a primary term selector there, and it's disabled when a multilingual plugin is active, as those modify the URL structure in a non-standard way.

**New robots.txt generator**

We've replaced the existing robots.txt writer with a priority-based generator. We've already added the ability to add your sitemap's location, block AI trainers, block SEO analysis crawlers, and limit access to the admin area. You can append, remove, and modify generator sections using filter `the_seo_framework_robots_txt_sections`.

**Updated administrative scripts**

We've significantly updated the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files. If you find issues with the interface, you may need to flush your browser caches. Check out our [KB article to learn more](https://tsf.fyi/kb/common-update-issues/).

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by posting [a fantastic review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or do your friends and colleagues a favor by installing TSF for them.

**Detailed log**

But surely it is obvious to everyone that all the endeavor of the part by which we learn is ever towards [knowledge of the truth of things](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4331#detailed).

### Full changelog

* **You can find the full changelog [here](https://theseoframework.com/?cat=2).**
