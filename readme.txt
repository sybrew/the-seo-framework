= What this plugin does, in a few lines =

* Automatically configures SEO for every page, post, taxonomy and term.
* Allows you to adjust the SEO globally.
* Allows you to adjust the SEO for every applicable page, post, taxonomy and term.
* Shows you how to improve your SEO with a beautiful SEO bar for each supported Post, Page and Taxonomy.

* Helps your pages get shared more beautiful through Facebook, Twitter and other social sites.
* Allows plugin authors to easily extend this plugin.
* Supports custom post types, like WooCommerce and bbPress.
* Automatically upgrades itself from Genesis Framework SEO.
* Allows for easy SEO plugin switch using a tool.

*Read [this guide](https://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/) for transferring SEO Content using SEO Data Transporter.

= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Numbers don't lie, performance matters =
Optimizing SEO is a fundamental process for any website. So we try to be non-intrusive with The SEO Framework.
The SEO Framework is byte and process optimized on PHP level, with each update the optimization is improved when possible.
Page rendering time matters in SEO. This is where we lay focus on.

* This plugin is written with massive and busy (multi-)sites in mind.
* This plugin uses various caching methods which store heavy calculations in memory and the database.
* This plugin is on average 1.49x to 1.95x faster compared to other popular SEO plugins.
* This plugin consumes on average 1.35x more server resources than other popular SEO plugins in exchange for improved performance.
* This plugin has on average 1.30 to 1.60x more database interactions in exchange for improved performance.
* And last but not least, this plugin always has 100% fewer advertisements. Let's keep it that way.

*Numbers may vary per installation and version. Last checked: 14th May 2016.*
*The numbers are based on actual plugin code runtime.*

= Completely pluggable =
The SEO Framework also features pluggable functions. All functions are active and can be called within the WordPress Loop.
This allows other developers to extend the plugin wherever needed.
We have also provided an API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

= Still not convinced? Let's dive deeper =

**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including image manipulation.
* Canonical, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Schema.org LD+Json script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org LD+Json script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org LD+Json script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org LD+Json script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Disables 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

> This plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/) and the [Domain Mapping plugin by Donncha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/).<br>
> This compatibility ensures **prevention of canonical errors**. This way your site will always be correctly indexed, no matter what you use!<br>

= Caching =

This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= About the Sitemap =

The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

= Other notes =

*Genesis Framework SEO will be disabled upon activating this plugin. This plugin takes over and extends Genesis Framework SEO.*

***The Automatic Description Generation will work with any installation, but it will exclude shortcodes. This means that if you use shortcodes or a page builder, be sure to enter your custom description or the description will fall short.***

***The home page tagline settings won't have any effect on the title output if your theme's title output is not written according to the WordPress standards, which luckily are enforced strongly on new WordPress.org themes since recently.***

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 90 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings and Social Meta Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer, how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I'm not a developer, how can I help? =

A way of donating is available through the donation link on the plugin website.
However, you can also greatly help by telling your friends about this plugin :).

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= Does this plugin collect my data? =

Absolutely not! Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not a problem. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.
If you're using W3 Total Cache you might be interested in [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3tc-auto-pilot/) to do it for you.

= Ugh, I don't want anyone to know I'm using The SEO Framework! =

Aww :(
Oh well, here's the filter you need to remove the HTML tags saying where the Meta tags are coming from:
`add_filter( 'the_seo_framework_indicator', '__return_false' );`

= I'm fine with The SEO Framework, but not with you! =

Well then! D: We got off on the wrong foot, I guess..
If you wish to remove "by Sybre Waaijer" from your HTML code, here's the filter:
`add_filter( 'sybre_waaijer_<3', '__return_false' );`

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.0 - Contemporary Aspiration =

**Release date:**
/
* TODO Planned: September 1st 2016

** Summarized:**
/
* As the Extension Manager is on its way, it's the first time I actually need to make use of this plugin's application framework.
* With this, I noticed some things are to be improved. And with this update, a lot has been. As this is an Open Source project, the source sometimes needs a little change too.
* This is a maintenance release, and although nothing noticable has been changed, added or fixed; however, this update makes everything a lot lighter on your server.
* For developers, the code has been cleaned up again, massively. Enjoy!
* For everyone, this plugin now makes use of the WordPress core term data handling. Making this plugin much more reliable, and 30% faster (according to xDebug) TODO is expected BENCHMARK to see real results.
* TODO This is my goal, but is it achieved? Update this if nessecary. NOTE: ACHIEVED (and new functionality) :D. Now make this a nicer read for the users.

**SEO Tip of the Update:**
/
* TODO

**Announcements:**
/
* TODO Extension Manager. (as promised since version 2.4.0)

**The goal of this update:**

**With this update, I wanted to improve this plugin in several ways.**
**Normally, this is listed as "for developers". This time, I've tried to make it more understandable for everyone.**

1. Minimizing the plugin's load time.
1. Reducing the plugin's database calls.
1. Reducing the plugin's server resource usage.
1. Increase the plugin's compatibility with other plugins and themes.
1. Upgrading the plugin to the latest WordPress standards.
1. Reducing future bug reports chance.
1. Improving the code quality and readability.
1. Helping developers out with better extensibility.
1. Better coding standards have been introduced.

**How this was achieved (in order set above):**

1. I've removed redundant function calls and I've added more efficient caches and ways of data handling.
1. I've removed temporarily database entries and I've exchanging them for permanent ones.
1. I've transferred all option metaboxes into separated files, which are only loaded when needed on the SEO settings page.
1. I've exchanged category and tag SEO data injection for WordPress 4.4+ term options. This will make sure premium themes can do whatever they want.
1. Alongside the previous upgrade, I've taken a very close look at the WordPress core functions, and adjusted code accordingly.
1. Because of all previous steps, this would follow naturally.
1. I've read all code once more, and discovered ways for improvement. It's like a spellcheck.
1. Throughout the code, better and more open standards have been introduced, where other developers can easily add to, disable or enable functionality.
1. With the help of a code linter, [WordPress.com VIP best practices](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/code-review-what-we-look-for/) have been enforced throughout the plugin. This resulted in increased security and overall performance.

**How do I benefit most of this update, and other plugins in general?**

* This update has been writting with the future in mind. Always make sure to:

1. Update to the latest WordPress version. This will make sure your website is secure and compatible.
1. Update to an actively supported PHP version. Did you know that PHP versions 5.5 and below are no longer updated against security vulnerabilities? Go [tell your hosting provider](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).
1. Process your theme through [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/). If the theme you wish to use fails many of these checks, feel free to tell the theme author. Bad standards lead to bad performance, compatibility issues, and sometimes even security vulnerabilities.

**Do you have thousands of categories and tags?**

* No problem! After the plugin has been updated, the first admin request might take a while longer while converting all term data to the new data system.
* After that, you're good to go. Enjoy!

**Detailed Log:**
/
***The code is strong with [this one](https://theseoframework.com/?p= TODO #detailed).***

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* General compatibility and other improvements for The SEO Framework's Extension Manager.
	* Facebook image width and height meta tags output.
	* Twitter image width and height meta tags output.
	* Genesis Framework 2.3.0+ term metadata upgrade and fallback compatibility.
	* Breadcrumbs images as per new Google requirements. Currently, archives contain an empty value.
* **Improved:**
	* The title and description counter type option is now bound to the user, rather than the site.
	* Dismissible notices are now dismissible on every admin page when called.
	* The term meta data is now handled through WordPress 4.4 or later functionality, if present.
		* Note: From The SEO Framework 2.8.0, backwards compatibility towards version 2.6.6.2 or lower will be removed in order to clean up the database.
		* Note: That update will not remove support for WordPress 3.8 onwards 4.4 term metadata. It only means that you won't be able to revert to old-style SEO metadata after updating either WordPress core or The SEO Framework.
	* JavaScript performance counting characters and updating previews, it's now "instant".
	* BuddyPress' will no longer output a duplicated canonical URL.
	* The dismissible notices created by The SEO Framework are now color-blind accessible through the addition of a small success, warning or failure icon.
	* Removed duplicated JavaScript calls on the SEO Settings pageload for improved browser loading time.
	* Leaving the SEO Settings page will now also generate a warning when you've pasted content into a text area.
* **Changed:**
	* The SEO Settings page is now a submenu page, name "SEO Settings". This change is only visible when another submenu is added.
	* The Twitter Image URL output is now wrapped in the `twitter:image` meta tag instead of `twitter:image:src`, as the latter seems to be deprecated.
* **Updated:**
	/
	* TODO POT translation file.
	* The counter type option has been reset as it's now handled per user instead of per site.
	* Because the breadcrumbs have been updated, the LD+Json transient cache has been invalidated and will be built up again. Old values are cleaned up automatically by WordPress core.
* **Removed:**
	* The SEO plugin detection module is relatively heavy; therefore, some plugins have been removed from checking conflicts against. These include:
		* Easy Facebook Share Thumbnail (hasn't recieved updates in 3 years).
		* SEO Facebook Comments (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* Simple Facebook Connect (plugin no longer exists).
		* Social Discussions (hasn't recieved updates in 3 years).
		* Socialize (hasn't recieved updates in 3 years).
		* Wordbooker (plugin no longer exists).
		* WP Caregiver (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* WP Facebook Like Send & Open Graph Meta (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* WP-OGP (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* Zolton.org Social Plugin (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* WP Facebook Like Button (plugin no longer exists).
		* MSM Sitemaps (plugin no longer exists).
		* WP Twitter Cards (hasn't recieved updates in 2 years).
		* iG:Twitter Cards (hasn't recieved updates in 3 years).
	* WordPress 4.3.4 and below are no longer to be supported in future updates.
		* From this update WordPress 3.9 and later should work as indended, but there will be no more effort to keep that intact.
		* From the next update, WordPress 4.3.3 or below could have issues with this plugin.
		* Note: Using WordPress 4.4 and later allows your website to have significant performance benefits in combination with this plugin from this update.
		* Note: There's one known bug with WordPress 3.9 that causes a fatal error when adding a new term. After page reload the term is correctly added.
			* This will not be fixed.
	* Internet Explorer 9 and below are no longer supported.
* **Fixed:**
	* Core trac ticket [37505](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37505#ticket).
	* When saving the SEO Options, the counter type was reset. This has been fixed by placing the counter type option out of the plugins options scope.
	* When updating the plugin, without added options, the update notification now really should no longer show up onwards from this update.
		* Note: no new options have been added in this update. So it might just show up once more unintentionally.
	* When solely changing the counter type within the SEO Options, an "unsaved changes" prompt will no longer be displayed.
	* When changing the WordPress Core tagline settings, the homepage description transient is now flushed, instead of the blog page (which could be on another page).
	* WooCommerce Product Tag and Category IDs can no longer conflict with singular post type IDs.
	* The LD+Json home URL output now doesn't add a trailing slash when your options don't have supplied one.
	* When your home URL is on a subdirectory, the canonical term URL is now correct.
	* When inputting HTML entities in the Custom Home Page Title, they're now correctly converted in the placeholder.
	* WPML's flags now display correctly again on WooCommerce product list overview.

**For translators:**

* **Added:**
	* A few new sentences.
* **Updated:**
	* A few sentences have had a very minor adjustment to be more in line with the rest of the WordPress/plugin environment.
* **Fixed:**
	* One sentence was never registered correctly. It has now been included within the translations.

**For developers:**

* **Added:**
	* Class overloading. Certain object actions are now handled in a correcting way to prevent insecure or deprecated API actions.
		* When acquiring a class variable, a deprecation handler is loaded.
			* This confirms the called variable prior to returning its value. If it's deprecated, it can and will now let you know.
		* Object cloning is now forbidden.
			* There are many class constructors in this framework that contain actions. When cloning the object, all these actions will run again. Causing (although not always notable) performance and security issues.
			* You can simply get the object using `the_seo_framework()` function.
			* Cloning will result in a fatal error.
		* Object wakeup is now forbidden.
			* From this update the framework makes use of `serialize()` for query caching. Although convinient, this can cause security issues.
			* The security issues are eliminated by disabling the method `__wakeup()` through visibility changes.
			* Waking up the class will result in a fatal error.
		* Inaccessible method calling is now handled with an error.
			* You can access every public function through `the_seo_framework()` function object.
			* If, for any reason, a method has been removed, the call will not emit a fatal error, but instead will output a notice.
			* As this is becoming a huge project in a rapid pace, it's perfectly understandable not every developer is up-to-date with the latest changes.
			* This will also make sure your site will stay accessible when, for example, an extension or plugin update causes an incompatibility within The SEO Framework.
	* Function `the_seo_framework_update_option()`, this allows you to update options remotely.
	* Function `the_seo_framework_options_page_slug()`, this allows you to hook into the SEO settings page.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Query::get_the_real_admin_ID()`, this always runs within `AutoDescription_Query::get_the_real_ID()` when in admin.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Sanitize::verify_seo_settings_nonce()`, returns true when SEO settings nonce has been verified. Always use this if you want to inject custom settings.
	* The debugger now shows Page and Paged Query variable output.
	* The debugger now shows Globals `multipage` and `numpages` variable output.
	* CDATA array (JavaScript) `autodescriptionL10n` now contains a nonce string for AJAX requests, accessible through (JavaScript) `autodescriptionL10n.nonce` or (JavaScript) `autodescriptionL10n['nonce']` and (PHP) `check_ajax_referer( 'autodescription-ajax-nonce', 'nonce' ) ?>`.
* **Improved:**
	* Class contents `AutoDescription_Query` are now reworked to be much more effecient and predictable.
	* Methods within `AutoDescription_Query` have been re-evaluated whether they use the WordPress query cache. If that holds true, the query object cache has been omitted from the said method.
	* Reduced plugin memory usage by 5% on the front-end.
	* Shortened the transient name for the LD+Json output. This ensures high post ID number transients are working correctly on old WordPress database versions.
	* This plugin has once more been profiled with xDebug to ensure the highest performance and eliminate culprits, even without Opcode Caching.
	* Method that alter the term data on request will no longer run if the term data has been updated to WordPress 4.4 standards. The affected methods are:
		* `AutoDescription_TermData::get_term_filter()`
		* `AutoDescription_TermData::get_terms_filter()`
		* `AutoDescription_TermData::taxonomy_seo_save()`
		* `AutoDescription_TermData::term_meta_delete()`
	* `AutoDescription_Query::get_the_real_ID()` processing time has been significantly reduced within the admin area.
	* The theme doing it right transient has been changed into a permanent transient, this means it's autoloaded with all other options. This transient acts like an option and is flushed on theme change.
	* WordPress VIP coding standards, including:
		* External pinging URLs are now cleaned prior to sending the request.
		* Sitemaps query objects are now being sent through `WP_Query`, rather than get_posts().
			* Sitemaps post queries are now suppressing filters.
		* Translation strings are sanitatized when needed.
		* Included better validation of superglobals.
		* Better PHP 5.3 compatibility has been introduces on URL parsing.
		* Increased usage of the WordPress core caching system so themes and other plugins can benefit from earlier calls.
			* This reduces memory usage and increases overal performance. Although not directly notable.
	* Transient and Object cache key generation based on type request now run earlier and bypass the static cache for improved performance and reduced memory heap size.
	* Method `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::init_columns_ajax()` now only runs on the applicable AJAX action, right before the tag is output. Instead of `admin_init`.
	* Method `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::init_columns_ajax()` now adapts its capability check towards WordPress Core filters.
	* Class autoloading support. Because of this, one class filenames have been changed to ease the autoload flow. This is:
		* `admininit.class.php` is now `admin-init.class.php`. That's it!
		* Note that autoloading, although now supported, is not implemented as it's not benefactory in terms of performance.
	* (JavaScript) The placeholder variables are no longer escaped multiple times. Instead they're converted to `jQuery text()` so they can't run code anymore.
	* The LD+JSon breadcrumbs now uses WordPress core cache to fetch the terms instead of a database query. Gaining 4x to 7x performance which also makes sure themes and widgets can use these findings.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Core::generate_dismissible_notice()` has been modified:
		* It can now escape all input.
		* It can now show an icon in front of it depending on the notice type.
		* It has two new parameters:
			* `(bool) $a11y`, default true. Settings this to false will prevent adding accessibility icons in front of the notice.
			* `(bool) $escape`, default true. Setting this to false will prevent escaping the output.
* **Changed:**
	* Variable 'AutoDescription_Siteoptions::seo_settings_page_slug' is now publicly accessible. Making it easier to add submenu items.
	* All class `AutoDescription_Metaboxes` metabox output function parameters have been shifted by one to the right to conform to the `add_metabox()` function return arguments. The first parameter is now used for the (unavailable and unused) post object. The second must be an array. This change affects the following methods:
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::title_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::description_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::homepage_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::social_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::knowledge_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::schema_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::robots_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::webmaster_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::sitemaps_metabox()`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::feed_metabox()`
	* All class `AutoDescription_Metaboxes` metabox output functions have been put into "views". These view files are included upon calling them. The files that are attached can only be used within the plugin scope. This massively reduces the plugin memory overhead.
	* A few class `AutoDescription_Debug` output functions have been put into "views", for the same reason as above.
	* Method `AutoDescription_TermData::get_term_data()` no longer returns `null` on author request.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Query::get_the_real_ID()` no longer falls back to `get_the_ID()` as `get_queried_object_id()` covers that already.
		* Note: This plugin shouldn't run within the loop on the front end. Nor should that function. It's completely cached the first time it runs (and when The SEO Framework caching engine is enabled).
		* Note: That function however does run within the loop in the admin area. Therefore it will directly return method `AutoDescription_Query::get_the_real_admin_ID()` when called in the admin area.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Generate::get_separator()`'s second parameter (whether to escape the output) now defaults to true instead of false.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Adminpages::make_checkbox()` now has gained an extra parameter to determine whether to escape the label and description prior to outputting. Defaults to true.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Generate::generate_home_page_description()` now has gained an extra parameter whether to escape the description. Defaults to true.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Generate_Url::get_relative_term_url()` now adds the home URL directory (if any) to the URL prior to making it relative. Preventing directory installation errors.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Admin_Init::the_counter_visualized()` has been renamed to `AutoDescription_Admin_Init::wp_ajax_update_counter_type()`. Without deprecation as it's marked private.
	* All CSS class prefixes have been set to `tsf`, which were prior `autodescription`, 'ad', 'theseoframework', `seoframework` or none at all.

		* It no longer checks for page id's on the first parameter, but only for page hooks.
		* It now checks for page id's on the second parameter.
		* It has been moved to class `AutoDescription_Query`. So it's now `AutoDescription_Query::is_menu_page()`.

	* Method `AutoDescription_Query::is_single()` first parameter can now be an array without crashing the site.

* **Will Fix:**
