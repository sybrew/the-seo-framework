= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full Domain Mapping, subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for Social Sites and Search Engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their set settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to prevent automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org Structured Data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.3 and higher.
* WordPress 4.4 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang and qTranslate X.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= Is there a Premium version? =

Nope! This plugin is all-inclusive.

= Free & Premium Extensions =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

The SEO Framework is its own self-serving technical framework. It keeps track of everything WordPress and SEO while it allows other plugins to interact with it easily.
Through its framework it allows you to SEO your complete website. It also allows for extensions and real-time alterations; for when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone; however, The SEO Framework provides an easier and faster way of doing so.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as Structured Data.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

= 3.0.0 - Eminence =

**Release date:**

* November 19th, 2017

**Did you know?**

* Since about a week ago, 3 new free extensions are available in the [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

**Summarized:**

* Finally, after 8 months of preparation, experimenting, testing, and coding, TSF 3.0 is here.
* This update focuses on improved social site interaction, WordPress' API coherence, and optimizing UX.
* To improve social site interaction, social site links can be added through author profile pages.
* The Open Graph protocol has been updated, so will your meta output.
* The canonical URL generation has been revised, and it now works mostly through WordPress' API.
* For improved UX we've added pixel counters, better tooltips, and admin color scheme adherence.
* Oh, you can also select the primary term for each hierarchical post type.

**New primary terms:**

* *In WordPress, terms are generally known as categories.*
* The primary term influences how canonical URLs are generated for the post, and how breadcrumbs are constructed.
* Next to each term selection list, you'll now see radio buttons pop up aside each selected term.
* The selected term will be assigned as the primary term.
* If no primary term is selected, an assigned term that has been implemented earliest on the site will be used.
* Note that this feature requires JavaScript to be enabled. Authors without JavaScript can't change the primary term.

**Revised canonical URLs:**

* The canonical URL generation has been completely rewritten. Most users won't notice anything from this.
* It now uses WordPress' 4.6+ canonical URL generation (backward-compatibility is provided), instead of an in-house "guessing" version.
* **So, the Canonical URL should now always be compatible with any plugin, out of the box.** This is great news for translation plugin users!
* Note that canonical URLs are no longer outputted on private or unpublished posts.
* Note that if a query isn't registered correctly, the URL will also stay empty. Or, in unlikely cases, it will link to the home page.
	* Contact the respective plugin author on such issues. I'd love to help them correct this.

**Finally, author SEO:**

* On profile pages of users with Author capabilities (or higher), two new settings have been added under heading **"Authorial Info"**.
* Here, authors can set their Facebook profile page and Twitter profile page.
* These links will be used in Open Graph and Twitter meta output.
* Note that the author's profile must be public for it to be used when sharing links.
* When no author links are set, the "new" fallback URLs from the Social Meta Settings will be used.
* Expand your authorial presence using the free [Articles Extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/).

**A better admin experience:**

* This plugin now uses your chosen admin color scheme, subtly. You can see it being used as highlights and for tooltips.
* About tooltips, they've been completely rewritten:
	* They now look for boundaries, so they won't fall off the page or bound box. They can also face down when needed.
	* They try to center themselves based on your initial pointer position.
	* They work perfectly on any touch screen, also using Windows Touch.
	* They no longer gulp down RAM, they use cutlery. Basically, fewer DOM items initiate them and they self-destruct as they disappear.
	* Tooltips are now used on every `[?]` mark, so you can instantly see what those marks convey.
* Title input and preview generation has also been completely rewritten, and this was a big challenge to implement:
	* Titles now update on various actions, like updating the visibility or name of the page.
	* Titles now show prefixes, like "Private:" or "Protected:". They'll try to fit neatly, wherever.
	* Character counters are now always correct; they no longer "guess", they "know".
	* Pixel counters have been added too. More on that below.
* The CSS and JS scripts implemented by TSF have been optimized even further. So your admin experience should be a little speedier.

**The pixel counter:**

* A character-count guideline is nice to have. But it remains a guideline, and you want facts... correct?
* So, we've added a pixel counter. This pixel counter knows exactly how much space your titles and descriptions take up in Google's SERP.
* To explain this difference visually: Five characters of "WWWWW" take up more space than five of "IIIII".
* Hover over the pixel counter to see how many pixels you've used.
* Through testing we found that time-sensitive items (i.e. articles) have less space available for descriptions.
* You can enable and disable the character and pixel counters at the Layout settings.
* Note that new installations won't get to see the character counter by default anymore.
* Note that the pixel counter isn't represented (yet) by the SEO Bar. So, you shouldn't have to worry about yellow or even red items.

**AI good structure:**

* You can now upload a square website logo. This is used in the [Articles Extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/), too.
* The "Site Name" project has been dropped, and this data is now fetched through other means, like the "Sitelinks Searchbox".
* Breadcrumbs have been revised, too. The generation is now smarter in tree selection, and only one breadcrumb is outputted, which uses your primary term selection.
* WooCommerce 3.0+ products are recognized correctly by search engines, once more.

**Privacy everywhere:**

* When you click on any link outputted by TSF on your domain, you can be certain it no longer carries any traceable information.

**A note on browser compatibility:**

* As we want to move forward, we don't believe we should be supporting insecure browsers.
* So, your admin experience will be degraded when using an outdated browser.
* Be sure to use at least IE 11, Safari 10, iOS 10, or better.
* We expect only a few users to be negatively affected. For everyone else, we welcome you to the future of browsing.

**Survey:**

* After updating and playing around with the update, feel free to fill in our [update survey](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1781). Tell us what you like or what could've been done better.
