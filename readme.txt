= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including automated image manipulation.
* Schema.org LD+Json script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org LD+Json script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org LD+Json script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org LD+Json script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Disables 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots' options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

> This plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/) and the [Domain Mapping plugin by Donncha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/).<br>
> This compatibility ensures **prevention of canonical errors**. This way your site will always be correctly indexed, no matter what you use!<br>

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= An additional sitemap =
The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 90 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings and Social Meta Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not a problem. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.
If you're using W3 Total Cache you might be interested in [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3tc-auto-pilot/) to do it for you.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.1 - Seceded Affiliation =

**Important Note:**

* PHP 5.2 hasn't recieved updates for [over 5 years](http://php.net/eol.php) and using it is a major security risk.
* **This maintenance release completely drops support for PHP 5.2**. So, if you're using PHP 5.2, from this update on you can no longer activate The SEO Framework.
* For developers PHP 5.2 is a practicality and convinience hindrance and is also source for bugs. Sometimes, we have to split simple code over multiple lines just to support it.
* WordPress is about to drop support for PHP 5.2 as well in WordPress 4.7.0. See proposed [trac ticket 36335](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36335).
* Inform your host to keep updated! Read more about informing your host [here](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).

**Summarized:**

* This maintenance release fixes ... TODO
* Class structure ... TODO
* Many functions now allow to echo the output now trough variable to prevent output sanitation mistakes... TODO
* WordPress.com VIP standards have been enforced even more.. TODO

**SEO tip of the Update:**

* Not all SEO techniques are actively used on Google outside of the United States.

* This changes over time as Google updates its Search Engine all over the world.
* Usage of experimental Schema.org scripts cause no harm to ranking.

**Did you know:**

* Each update name and link to the detailed log are a play on words about something in a particular event, movie, series, quote, or the update contents itself.

**For developers:**

**Methods are no longer annotated by their classname in the changelog; instead they're now annotated with the object `the_seo_framework()->`**.

	* All classes have been renamed.
		* They are now preceded by `The_SEO_Framework\`, in accordance to their newly acquired namespace.
		* For example, `AutoDescription_Feed` is now `The_SEO_Framework\Feed`.

	* File `query.class.php` now falls under GPLv3 instead of GPLv2+.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` is now marked private. It's written and used as an internal handler for filters.
* **Improved:**
	/
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` now passes objects, so you can use `$this` in the called function.
	* Class overloading magic methods (`__wakeup()`, `__call()`, `__get()`, `__set()`) are now only initiated once and can't be reinitated or overloaded.
	* TODO The old option update handler has been moved into the new 2.7.0 update handler.
		* This prevents duplicated and constant option update checks.
	/
	* TODO All admin actions have been moved into an admin action handler.

		* This changes the admin `init` (not `admin_init`) action initialization from priority `0` to priority `1`.
	/
	* TODO All front-end actions have been moved into a front-end action handler.

= 2.7.0 - Contemporary Aspiration =

**Release date:**

* September 9th 2016

**Summarized:**

* This is a major maintenance release. Although nothing notable has been changed, added or fixed; nevertheless, this update makes everything a lot lighter on your server.
* As the Extension Manager is on its way, it's the first time I actually needed to make use of this plugin's application framework. With this, I noticed some things had to be improved; and with this update, a lot has been.
* For developers, the code has been cleaned up again, massively. Enjoy!
* For everyone, this plugin now makes use of the WordPress core term data handling. Which makes this plugin much more reliable, lighter and faster.
* This update brings 19 new features, more than 24 bugs have been fixed and over 42 improvements have been introduced.

**SEO Tip of the Update:**

* One of the most critical aspects of SEO is being found. However, Google isn't likely to trust your website until others do. This greatly affects your website's ranking.
* Because of this, your website needs to be linked to by trusted sources. The more trustworthy a source is, the more trust your website gains at Google.
* Google needs to understand the relation between your website and another as well. If a site talks about hosting events, and your site is about one particular type of event, they are likely compatible.
* If your website sells candy, be careful not to place a link towards or on an agency website when your website is new.
* So, do not ever spread your first links across multiple websites that are completely unrelated to yours.
* Do not forget to link to other related websites, this way Google knows what your website is about. For example, Google can then distinguish Apple (technology) from apple (fruit).

**Announcements:**

1. **The SEO Framework Extension Manager** (as promised since version 2.4.0) is now in alpha!
	* [GitHub page](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager).
	* [Get a copy](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/archive/master.zip).
	* [Open an issue](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/issues).
	* **Note:** That plugin requires PHP 5.4 or later.
	* **Note:** That plugin requires The SEO Framework 2.7.0 and WordPress 4.4 or later.
	* **Warning:** That plugin makes API requests to https://premium.theseoframework.com/ and https://webmasters.googleblog.com/.
	* **Warning:** The privacy policy for these API requests have not yet been set up.
	* **Warning:** Use at own risk.
1. No more features will be added to The SEO Framework.
	* **Exception:** If a feature covers a wide range of website types and is required for Google and Bing, it will be added to The SEO Framework.
	* **Reason:** I want to keep The SEO Framework as stable, light and clean as possible.

**The goal of this update:**

With this update, I wanted to improve this plugin in several ways.
Normally, this is listed as "for developers"; however, this time, I've tried to make it more understandable for everyone.

1. Minimizing the plugin's load time.
1. Reducing the plugin's database calls.
1. Reducing the plugin's server resource usage.
1. Increase the plugin's compatibility with other plugins and themes.
1. Upgrading the plugin to the latest WordPress standards.
1. Reducing future bug reports chance.
1. Improving the code quality and readability.
1. Helping developers out with better extensibility.
1. Better coding standards have been introduced.

How this was achieved (in order set above):

1. I've removed redundant function calls and I've added more efficient caches and ways of data handling.
1. I've removed temporarily database entries and I've exchanging them for permanent ones so they're autoloaded through WordPress.
1. I've transferred all option metaboxes into separated files, which are then only loaded when needed on the SEO settings page.
1. I've exchanged category and tag SEO data injection for WordPress 4.4+ term options. This will make sure premium themes can do whatever they want.
1. Alongside the previous upgrade, I've taken a very close look at the WordPress core functions, and adjusted code accordingly to prevent conflicts.
1. Because of all previous steps, this would follow naturally.
1. I've read all code once more, line by line, and discovered ways for improvement. It's like a spellcheck.
1. Throughout the code, better and more open standards have been introduced; where other developers can easily add to, disable or enable functionality.
1. With the help of a code linter, [WordPress.com VIP best practices](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/code-review-what-we-look-for/) have been enforced throughout the plugin. This resulted in increased security and overall performance.

**How do I benefit most of this update, and other plugins in general?**

This update has been writting with the future in mind. Always make sure to:

1. Update to the latest WordPress version. This will make sure your website is secure and compatible.
1. Update to an actively supported PHP version. Did you know that PHP versions 5.5 and below are no longer updated against security vulnerabilities? Go [tell your hosting provider](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).
1. Process your theme through [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/). If the theme you wish to use fails many of these checks, feel free to tell the theme author. Bad standards lead to bad performance, compatibility issues, and sometimes even security vulnerabilities.

***Note: This plugin upgrades its term metadata automatically within the admin area to WordPress 4.4 standards, if you have WordPress 4.4+ installed.***

**Do you have thousands of categories and tags?**

* No problem! After the plugin has been updated, the first admin request might take a while longer while converting all term data to the new data system.
* After that, you're good to go. Enjoy!

**WordPress compatibility will be changed.**

* This is the last update to receive support for WordPress 3.9 and later.
* Only WordPress 4.3.4 or later will continue to receive support after this update, until further announcement.

**Are you a translation editor?**

* Please check out and update the newly improved translations. It should take less than 10 minutes.
