= We poured over 18&#160;000 hours into this plugin. Here are the results: =

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest you how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, free and for the professionals =

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

= Behind the screens =

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

= Compatibility =

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 7.2 and higher.
* WordPress 5.5 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Unicode (UTF-8) character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJKV (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese).
* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, et al.), through its interface and metatag generation.
* Complete color-vision deficiency accessibility thanks to a carefully picked color scheme.
* Full keyboard navigation, so that you can inspect tooltips quickly without ever having to reach for your mouse.
* Full screen-reader accessibility via field anchors, ARIA labels, and title attributes.
* WordPress Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection and output of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Full integration with WordPress Core sitemaps.
* Output of structured data via Schema.org JSON-LD scripts.
* Altering oEmbed for improved sharing on Discord.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* E-commerce plugins like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.
* Forum plugins like bbPress and wpForo.
* Editing posts and terms via WordPress's native bulk-and-quick-edit interfaces.
* Headless mode via a single [constant definition](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=136).

= Copyright legislation notice =

In a few words: The SEO Framework allows search engines to do what they've been doing for the past 20 years via its preconfigured copyright settings.

When you activate The SEO Framework on any site, you automatically grant rights to content aggregators, among Google, Bing, and Yandex, to obtain and use information from the site, including written work, images, audio, and video. You can control these rights via the robots-meta settings brought by this plugin. Your rights and the effectiveness of these settings are subject to your website's region and language, and the physical or virtual origin of the platform and their potential users through which your website's information is obtained and shared. It is up to the aggregator to honor your rights and the requests brought via The SEO Framework.

If you wish to learn more, please refer to the [EU commission on copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules). These rulings may propagate its effects through regions outside the EU.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, et al. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= I don't see the breadcrumbs! =

The SEO Framework does not provide the display of breadcrumbs. This is theme-territory. This plugin only annotates them for search engines via a JSON-LD script.

If you wish to display breadcrumbs, then your theme should provide this. Alternatively, there are [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/breadcrumbs/) that help you do this.

== Changelog ==

TODO require PHP 7.3 henceforth? (Requires PHP in head and readme)

TODO When filling in the Meta Description for the homepage as page, the generated Social titles aren't locked to that on the SEO Settings page.
	-> Consider that overriding the homepage description, the generated social inputs should be unlocked, unless one is filled in via the homepage page-settings.
	-> Does this affect the title as well? Test this.

TODO add toggle for homepage settings where each "language" installed can be altered accordingly.
	-> This requires probably a whole lot more work than I'd have hoped.
	-> This can go wrong if the default language changes, or disappears.
		-> But, this is effectively the same issue we have with Custom Post Type Archives.
			-> Speaking of which, we should also have such a switcher for those... ugh.
TODO check mail Dean about WPML config

TODO change autodescription-updates-cache to autodescription-persistent-cache?
	-> In theory, we can just delete the old one; since it has no data that is required for normal operation.
		-> However, this may cause a notification pop up for those who use two or more SEO plugins simultaneously. Though this may be helpful.

TODO db version 4270 -> 4290+

TODO add bespoke support for Events Calendar?
	-> Basically, we need to overwrite the separator
		-> We can do this via WordPress document title filters.
	-> We need to recognize that their "archives" isn't an archive, so we should remove the prefix.
		-> Simple.

TODO implement "@hook wp_action" in every function with a callback.
	-> If something is a callback of a hook AND something else, we may want to depict that differently?
		E.g.: @hook ~ wp_action
	-> Then, we can remove unused variables (often tagged with "Unused.").

TODO all "s_" methods are a mixed bag of:
	1. Option filters without default fallback.
	2. Option filters with default fallback. (get_default_option)
	3. Option filters with current AND default fallback. (get_option, get_default_option)
	4. Non-option filters.
-> We should overhaul this in a major update?
	-> Or, do it now? We're the only ones making thorough use of this, and assume a default only for selectable options.
		-> Therefore, we can safely assume no one falls back to the default for "text"-based options, which is often what users filter.

TODO the detect.*?plugins() functions use a foreach loop and then in_array() -- this can be slow, consider array_intersect instead?
	-> Test performance.

TODO make 4.3.0 instead of 4.2.9?
	-> This way we can push through large API changes, clean up soon-to-be-deprecations, sanitizations, etc.
	-> We can also add Twitter Card type to every post
	-> We can also justify major change for Title/Description output.
	-> And we can justify jumping to PHP 7.3, so we can start using hrtime instead of microtime.

TODO two new classes:
	1. Option_Filter (See below "Four new classes")
		-> Maintain index of all options to be sanitized.
			-> Load early, so we can sanitize whatever tries to update the option.
		-> Should work with class "Option"?
			-> Falls back to default on failure for every option?
				-> How do we determine failure? Out of range?
		-> Relays to Sanitize
	2. Sanitize
TODO Four new classes:
	0. The_SEO_Framework\Data\
		1. Options
			x. \Filter
		2. User_Options
		3. Post_Data
		4. Term_Data

TODO add summary_large_image/summary toggle on a per-page basis
	- Namely this affects how the image is displayed in both Twitter AND Discord.

TODO highlight in large changes:
	* Color scheme works again for tooltips.
	* Issue with caching plugins and WordPress Core vulnerability yet unresolved?
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/meta-block-sometimes-not-inserted/.
		* https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues/2217.
		* Also notify Nik via email?
	* Multisite support for author SEO fields.

If we go through with 4.3.0, consider removing deprecated filters (filters_deprecated)

**Detailed log**

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* SEOPress metadata is now detected when activating the plugin for the first time, so TSF can suggest to [migrate SEO metadata](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/transport/).
	* On multisite, you can now inspect and edit user SEO metadata ("Authorial Info") for any users that have author capabilities on any (other) blog.
		* This capability is by default `edit_posts`, predefineable via constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_AUTHOR_INFO_CAP`.
* **Changed:**
	* TSF no longer pings search engines the base sitemap location when updating the options without changing the options.
	* TSF now requires WordPress v5.9 or later, from WordPress v5.5 or later.
	* The Homepage SEO Settings box's title no longer carries a warning; instead, we added a bigger, more noticable warning to every settings section when editing the homepage.
		* We're getting too many support inquiries about this; sorry about the noise, but it ought to decrease confusion.
		* This also works around an issue where Gutenberg still doesn't understand HTML.
		* This also works around an issue where Gutenberg leadership does not respect the community that allowed them to create the everlasting abomination and [fix all the points made here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7960), which would take about 5 hours of work -- postponed for 5 years already.
* **Improved:**
	* The plugin is faster now due to [new](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1654101713714831361) [coding](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1678409334626172928) [standards](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1678412864200093696).
	* Multiple types of homepages are no longer tested when fetching custom metadata, improving performance when viewing the administrative post list.
	* The main query is no longer performed by WordPress when loading the sitemap, removing 10 redundant database queries.
		* Related Core ticket is [#51117](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51117).
	* Sticky posts are no longer calculated when generating the sitemap, removing a redundant database query.
		* Related Core ticket is [#51542](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51542).
	* A new multilingual plugin conflict detection is implemented. Polylang, WPML, TranslatePress, and WPGlobus are detected by default as potentially conflicting. When a potentially conflicting multilingual plugin is detected:
		* A warning is displayed above the homepage settings.
		* A warning is displayed above the Post Type Archive settings.
		* A warning is displayed at the Sitemap Output settings.
* **Fixed:**
	* Even if WordPress can't fulfill a JSON-type request, WordPress will falsely report it's parsing JSON-formatted content. Caching plugins ignore this, and create a copy of this JSON-type response as a regular page, with the content altered -- [learn more](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/meta-block-sometimes-not-inserted/#post-16559784). TSF no longer stops outputting SEO metadata when a JSON-type is requested by a visitor, so caching plugins won't accidentally store copies without metadata any longer.
		* Akin to `is_admin()`, unexpected behavior will occur in WordPress, themes, and plugins when sending JSON headers. We deem this a security issue, although Automattic thinks differently (hence, Jetpack is still vulnerable to `/?_jsonp=hi`, and so are hundreds of other plugins). Because we treated this as a security issue, we had to wait for Automattic to report back.
		* We consider the following WordPress API functions dangerous, and we advise security researchers investigating plugins utilizing these:
			- `wp_is_json_request()`
			- `wp_is_jsonp_request()`
			- `wp_is_xml_request()`
	* Tooltip text is now more specifically colored white, making text legible again with some custom admin themes.
	* Addressed a regression from TSF v4.2.0 where WordPress admin color schemes stopped affecting TSF's color scheme. Affected are:
		* Tooltip background and text color.
		* Post/Page SEO Settings active-tab border color.
	* Title and description lengths are now calculated more quickly and more accurately for the SEO Bar.
	* Words with attached plain connector punctuation (`l'apostrophe`) now get tested correctly for repeated words.
	* Words with attached plain connector punctuation (`l'apostrophe`) are now considered starting or mid-sentence words, so the `l'`-part of `l'apostrophe` will also be included in the description when it's at the start, and the `apostrophe` part won't be trimmed anymore if not followed by at least 2 more words or final punctuation (dot).
	* Dashlane is being decadent by first removing a perfectly good desktop app, and then they quickly stopped adhering to agreed upon web accessibility standards. Since, it is trying to shove their own "standard" down our throats. We won't mention that "standard," for no one should use it.
		* You should try Nordpass, for Dashlane's incompetence [shall not pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xYXUeSmb-Y).
	* The SEO Settings meta box is now also styled correctly inside the Block Editor for other post types than 'post' when positioned under the content.
		* Most notably, the padding and border around the settings make it much easier on your eyes.
	* Fixed a [bug in Polylang](https://github.com/polylang/polylang/issues/928) that breaks all plugins but Yoast SEO and achieves nothing but slowing down your site -- simply, by purging Polylang's egregious AJAX-handler from browser memory.
* **Removed:**
	* The following plugins are no longer recognized as conflicting plugins:
		* SEO: Yoast SEO Premium (Yoast SEO needs to be active for Yoast SEO Premium to work).
			* Yoast SEO is still checked for.
		* Sitemaps: Simple Wp Sitemap ([abandoned](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-wp-sitemap/)).
* **Note:**
	* Transient `tsf_sitemap_5_%`, where % changes per blog ID and language, is no longer used. This transient should clear automatically.
	* Transient `tsf_exclude_1_%`, where % changes per blog ID and language, is no longer used. This transient will be deleted on upgrade.

**For translators:**

* **Added:** New translation strings are available.
* **Updated:** TODO A new POT file is available.

**For developers:**

* **Added:**
	* `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache`, provides a collection of static caching interface methods.
	* Transient `tsf_sitemap_{$sitemap_id}_{$revision}_{$blog_id}_{$locale}` may now be stored for sitemaps.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_auto_description_html_method_methods` is new.
		* This used to be `the_seo_framework_auto_descripton_html_method_methods` (typo).
	* Setting `auto_description_html_method` for `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`).
		* This used to be `auto_descripton_html_method` (typo).
	* New action, `the_seo_framework_cleared_sitemap_transients`, used when sitemap transients are (probably) cleared.
	* Method `tsf()->detect_multilingual_plugins()` is now available.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_multilingual_plugin_detected` is also new.
* **Improved:**
	* Method `tsf()->__set()` now protects against fatal errors on PHP 8.2 or later.
* **Changed:**
	* Method `tsf()->query_supports_seo()` removed detection for JSON(P) and XML type requests, because these cannot be assumed as legitimate.
	* `tsf()->_init_sitemap()` no longer is called with `template_redirect`, but at `parse_request` at priority `15`.
		* This makes loading the sitemap anywhere from barely noticeable to thousands of times faster, depending on which other plugins and themes you have installed. This is because we no longer load the main query like this.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_sitemap_endpoint_list` now accepts `cache_id` for every entry.
	* Method `tsf()->escape_description()` now requires a first parameter.
	* Method `tsf()->s_excerpt()` now requires a first parameter.
	* Method `tsf()->s_excerpt_raw()` now requires a first parameter.
	* Method `tsf()->escape_title()` now requires a first parameter.
	* Method `tsf()->is_profile_edit()` now also tests network admin profile screens.
	* Method `tsf()->s_min_max_sitemap()`
		1. Now also sanitizes the default fallback value.
		2. No longer falls back to the default option, but 1000 instead.
	* Method `tsf()->s_image_preview()` now falls back to `'large'` instead of `'standard'`.
	* Method `tsf()->s_left_right()` no longer falls back to option or default option, but a language-based default instead.
	* Method `tsf()->s_left_right_home()` no longer falls back to option or default option, but a language-based default instead.
	* Method `tsf()->s_twitter_card()` no longer falls to the default option, but `'summary_large_image'`.
	* Constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DEBUG` is now always available at `plugins_loaded`.
	* Class `\The_SEO_Framework\Internal\Debug` is now marked private. It was never meant to be public.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` now supports index `'multilingual'`.

	* Resolved PHP warning when editing a post type with altered term type availability.
	* Resolved PHP warning when editing a user with editor capabilities on the primary network's site via WordPress Multisite user-edit interface.
	* The `<font>` tag is deprecated, so we updated the tag to `<span>` in the debug panels.
* **Deprecated:**
	* Action `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_sitemap` is now soft deprecated (i.e., without warning). Use `the_seo_framework_cleared_sitemap_transients` instead.
		* Full deprecation with notice will start from TSF v4.3.0.
	* Property `tsf()->the_seo_framework_use_transients` is now soft-deprecated (i.e., without warning). There is no alternative.
		* Full deprecation with notice will start from TSF v4.3.0.

* **Removed:**
	* We dropped class `\The_SEO_Framework\Cache` from the god object `tsf()`. The following methods have been removed, because they weren't useful for the public APIs:
		* `init_admin_caching_actions`
		* `init_post_cache_actions`
		* `set_plugin_check_caches`
			* This is now `tsf()->reset_check_plugin_conflicts()`.
		* `delete_main_cache`
		* `delete_post_cache`
		* `delete_excluded_ids_cache`
			* This has been moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache::clear_excluded_post_ids_cache()`.
		* `delete_excluded_post_ids_transient`
		* `delete_cache`
		* `set_transient`
			* Use WordPress builtin instead.
			* This method will emit a deprecation warning from TSF v4.3.0.
		* `get_transient`
			* Use WordPress builtin instead.
			* This method will emit a deprecation warning from TSF v4.3.0.
		* `get_exclusion_transient_name`
		* `get_sitemap_transient_name`
			* This has been moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Sitemap::get_transient_key()`.
		* `generate_cache_key`
		* `generate_cache_key_by_type`
		* `add_cache_key_suffix`
			* This has been moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache::build_unique_cache_key_suffix()`.
		* `delete_sitemap_transient_permalink_updated`
			* This has been moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache::_refresh_sitemap_transient_permalink_updated()`, but not part of the public API.
		* `delete_sitemap_transient`
			* This has been moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache::clear_sitemap_transients()`.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_args` is gone.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_{$type}` is gone. This includes `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_sitemap` and `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_excluded_post_ids`.
		* We kept `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_sitemap` for now, but we'll deprecate it later.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_auto_descripton_html_method_methods`.
		* It is now `the_seo_framework_auto_description_html_method_methods` (typo in "description").
		* We found no indication this was used in public yet, so we didn't go through a deprecation process. Sorry in advance if this still affects your site.
	* Setting `auto_descripton_html_method` from `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`).
		* It is now `auto_description_html_method`.
	* Removed inline Right-To-Left CSS registration from `tsf-pt`, this is handled in its file now.
	* Deprecated filter `the_seo_framework_load_options` (deprecated in v4.1.4) is now gone.
	* Constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DISABLE_TRANSIENTS` is no longer used.
	* Method `tsf()->init_debug_vars()`, this was never meant to be public.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_warn_homepage_global_title` is now gone.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_warn_homepage_global_description` is now gone.
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_tell_multilingual_sitemap` is now gone.
* **Other:**
	* Cleaned up code. Reduced function call overhead.
	* Removed capitalization in PHP methods; mainly, `_ID`. Since PHP methods are case-insensitive at runtime, this should not matter nearly any case.
	* Fixed typos in code. Props [Viktor Szépe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).
	* Refreshed `composer.json`. Props [Viktor Szépe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).
	* Improved needless defense clauses. Props [Viktor Szépe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).

= 4.2.8 =

This minor update makes the SEO Bar easier on the eyes. We also improved compatibility with bbPress, wpForo, and WooCommerce, and added compatibility with another thousand plugins via Advanced Query Protection’s new plugin query variable detection. We also fixed a couple of bugs, added and improved syntax detection of SEOPress and Rank Math, introduced new APIs, dusted off some code, refined tooltip placement, added Site Icon as a fallback for the sitemap title logo, and perfected support for Custom Post Types by detecting [their changed arguments](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4059).

= 4.2.7 =

This minor update brings you a revamped HTML parser and a new option for tuning its accuracy for descriptions. First-time installers are now notified when metadata can be transported from other SEO plugins, the SEO Bar recognizes syntax from Rank Math, and Advanced Query Protection blocks new SEO attacks that could tank your rankings. We also [fixed a couple of bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4021).

*Psst: Check out our [Cyber Sale](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3527).*

*v4.7.2.1: Fixed syntax for PHP 7.2. Props [opicron](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/syntax-error-226/#post-16183422).*

= 4.2.6 =

This patch resolves an issue with WordPress 6.1, which queries template parts before posts are requested. This premature query causes TSF to fail in recognizing support for Custom Post Types, [preventing all meta output](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4015).

= 4.2.5 =

This minor update addresses a change in WordPress 6.0 that causes taxonomy sitemaps to crash, allows paginated deindexing to supersede forced indexing, and improves image cropping by [preserving metadata](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3929).

= 4.2.4 =

This minor update improves image processing, reducing TSF's load impact by roughly 20% when generating metadata. We also added WordPress 6.0 support for image filesizes, making social sharing [even more robust](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3903).

= 4.2.3 =

This minor update addresses a regression where the singular-archive canonical URLs always [pointed to the first page](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3858).

= 4.2.2 =

This minor update addresses a regression where the homepage canonical URL was [missing a trailing slash](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3841).

= 4.2.1 =

This minor update addresses a few regressions brought in v4.2.0; it fixes the canonical URL for paginated categories, corrects an API typo, and [rectifies a few edge cases](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3836). TSF now also supports PHP 8.1.

= 4.2.0 - Perfect =

*Come with me, and you'll be in a world of pure imagination. - [Gene Wilder, Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY)*

**Release highlights**

* This update brings new post-type-archive settings. You can now edit their titles, descriptions, social and visibility settings, and even add redirects on the SEO Settings page.
* Fancy a custom site title for SEO purposes only? Check out the new title settings.
* You will find that the sitemap's stylesheet now has its URLs centered; it also supports mobile devices.
* Developers can now enjoy using the new `tsf()` function -- an alias of `the_seo_framework()`.
* If you're a developer, you should also check out our perfectly tuned `memo()`. `umemo()`, and `fmemo()` [functions](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/blob/4.2.0/inc/functions/api.php#L155-L335), which help make TSF so performant.

**Perfect**

TSF is finally what I (Sybre) envisioned it to become when I first named it "The SEO Framework": It's lightning-fast, hassle-free, and has all necessary options while giving you the best in class experience. I hope you enjoy what I believe is a perfect product!

To me, The SEO Framework is finished. Done. It's excellent. This doesn't mean its journey ends here. Now, it's time to add features *you* want. A restyled interface, migration support, custom title generation, more structured data fields, and many other community proposals are under consideration.

**A perfect tip**

This update comes with updated browser styles and scripts. Not all browsers get these for you; so, the interface might appear broken (and your "inputs" seem to be "removed"). Try a different browser, or [clear your favorite browser's cache](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-clear-browser-cache/#how-to-force-refresh-a-single-page). That ought to do the trick.

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 5.1 through 5.4 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Over 66% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using WordPress v5.5 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with; for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

PHP 5.6 through 7.1 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Almost 80% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using PHP v7.2 or later.
* Newer versions of PHP are faster and more secure. For us, they're also easier to work with.
* Again, supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by sharing [a fantastic review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or do your friends and colleagues a favor by installing TSF for them.
